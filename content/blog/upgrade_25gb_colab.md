summary: This is a simple guide on how to get a colab runtime with high ram (25GB) and possibly with a Tesla P100 GPU

*High RAM Colab Runtime*

Iâ€™ll keep this simple and sweet
> # Open this Notebook in Colab and Run: [https://github.com/satyajitghana/TSAI-DeepVision-EVA4.0/blob/master/Utils/Colab_25GBRAM_GPU.ipynb](https://github.com/satyajitghana/TSAI-DeepVision-EVA4.0/blob/master/Utils/Colab_25GBRAM_GPU.ipynb)

That is it, you have a 25GB High RAM ðŸ¤© session in Colab, Go Crazy !

If you open the .ipynb file with notepad then youâ€™ll see this metadata

    "machine_shape": "hm"

which enables the High Memory runtime in Colab

I feel high memory session tends to get a P100, but if you did not get a P100, try resetting the runtime

    Runtime -> Factory reset runtime

Reconnect and check if you got a P100, if not try with a different account, and repeat, usually new accounts get a P100 easily

Thatâ€™s it Folks ðŸ˜›

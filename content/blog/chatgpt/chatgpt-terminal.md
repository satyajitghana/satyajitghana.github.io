# ChatGPT

Can you belive i am writing this article on VSCode being assisted by a LLM, and i am writing about a LLM?, isn't it really really really mind blowing? and all of things came up in just past 2 years.

I think there have been two major breakthroughs this year, Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT.

So here is the converstation between me and ChatGPT, trying to make it act like a Ubuntu Linux Terminal.

First of all ChatGPT has added a lof of content filters so that it does not impersonate anything or anyone, and these patches are being released every day to reduce the abuse people are doing with this model.
